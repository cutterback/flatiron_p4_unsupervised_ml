# Neural Networks - Recap 

## Key Takeaways

The key takeaways from this section include:

* Neural networks are powerful models that can be customized and tweaked using various amounts of nodes, layers, ...
* The most basic neural networks are single-layer densely connected neural networks, which have very similar properties as logistic regression models
* Compared to more traditional statistics and ML techniques, neural networks perform particularly well when using unstructured data
* Apart from densely connected networks, other types of neural networks include convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and generative adversarial neural networks 
* When working with image data, it's important to understand how image data is stored when working with them in Python
* Logistic regression can be seen as a single-layer neural network with a sigmoid activation function
* Neural networks use loss and cost functions to minimize the "loss", which is a function that summarizes the difference between the actual outcome (eg. pictures contain santa or not) and the model prediction (whether the model correctly identifies pictures with santas)
* Backward and forward propagation are used to estimate the so-called "model weights"
* Adding more layers to neural networks can substantially increase model performance
* Several activations can be used in model nodes, you can explore with different types and evaluate how it affects performance
