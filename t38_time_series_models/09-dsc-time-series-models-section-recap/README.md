# Modeling Time Series Data - Recap

## Key Takeaways

The key takeaways from this section include:  

* A white noise model has a fixed and constant mean and variance, and no correlation over time  
* A random walk model has no specified mean or variance, but has a strong dependence over time  
* The Pandas `.corr()` method can be used to return the correlation between various time series in the DataFrame  
* Autocorrelation allows us to identify how strongly each time series observation is related to previous observations  
* The Autocorrelation Function (ACF) is a function that represents autocorrelation of a time series as a function of the time lag  
* The Partial Autocorrelation Function (or PACF) gives the partial correlation of a time series with its own lagged values, controlling for the values of the time series at all shorter lags  
* ARMA (Autoregressive and Moving Average) modeling is a tool for forecasting time series values by regressing the variable on its own lagged (past) values  
* ARMA models assume that you've already detrended your data and that there is no seasonality
