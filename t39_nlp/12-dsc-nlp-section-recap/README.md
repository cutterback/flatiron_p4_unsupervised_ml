# Natural Language Processing - Recap

## Key Takeaways

The key takeaways from this section include:

* NLP has become increasingly popular over the past few years, and NLP researchers have achieved very insightful insights  
* The Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) is one of the most popular Python libraries for NLP
* Regular Expressions are an important part of NLP, which can be used for pattern matching and filtering
* Regular Expressions can become confusing, so make sure to use our provided cheat sheet the first few times you work with regex
* It is strongly recommended you take some time to use regex tester websites to ensure you understand how changing your regex pattern affects your results when working towards a correct answer!
* Feature Engineering is essential when working with text data, and to understand the dynamics of your text
* Common feature engineering techniques are removing stop words, stemming, lemmatization, and n-grams
* When diving deeper into grammar and linguistics, context-free grammars and part-of-speech tagging is important
* In this context, parse trees can help computers when dealing with ambiguous words 
* _How_ you clean and preprocess your data will have a major effect on the conclusions you'll be able to draw in your NLP classification problems
