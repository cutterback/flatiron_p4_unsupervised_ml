# Tuning Neural Networks - Recap

## Key Takeaways

The key takeaways from this section include: 

* Validation and test sets are used when iteratively building deep neural networks
* Like traditional machine learning models, we need to watch out for the bias variance trade-off when building deep learning models
* Several regularization techniques can help us limit overfitting: L1 Regularization, L2 Regularization, Dropout Regularization, etc ...
* Training of deep neural networks can be sped up by using normalized inputs
* Normalized inputs can also help mitigate a common issue of vanishing or exploding gradients 
* Examples of alternatives for gradient descent are: RMSprop, Adam, Gradient Descent with Momentum, etc. 
* Hyperparameter tuning is of crucial importance when working with deep learning models, as setting the parameters right can lead to great improvements in model performance
